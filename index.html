    <p> I'm an Inquisitive <strong>DIY</strong> individual. Over the years, I have ventured into various yet
        related aspect of electrical engineering <strong> Embedded Systems,
        IOT, Software Engineering(Frontend)</strong> and recently<strong>  Data science</strong>.I developed skill set
        in a range of technologies and frameworks, including <strong> Python, SQL, Scikit-Learn, Azure</strong>.
        Data science gives me a glimpses into the future üòä. I am currently focused on building responsible machine learning
        solutions.
        Most importantly, I am a wife and mother of four lovely kids, and I enjoy visiting places and reading crime novels.

                        I was able to acquire a better and structural understanding of the fundamentals of AI concepts,
                        machine learning algorithms, and a glimpse into the exciting world of deep learning and its
                        applications. I was able to build my first chat box after basic classes on <strong>Prompt Engineering</strong>.
                        I was exposed to capabilities of AI models like <strong>ChatGBT</strong> and <strong>Gimini</strong>.

                        are a few of the skills acquired. I built machine learning models for supervised and unsupervised
                        learning tasks, and I created visualizations to explain data characteristics and model predictions
                        for non-technical audience.
